# Automatic-Soap-Dispensor

Components Used:

Arduino board
Breadboard
Servo motor
IR Sensor
Jumper cables

Project Overview:

This project is an Automatic Soap Dispenser based on IoT technology. It utilizes an IR sensor to detect the presence of a hand and activates servo motors to dispense soap automatically. The system ensures touchless operation, making it more hygienic and efficient.

Working Principle:

The IR sensor detects motion when a hand is placed near the dispenser.
Upon detection, the servo motors rotate to push the soap dispenser nozzle.
If no motion is detected, the servos remain in their default position.

Features:

Touchless operation for hygiene
Real-time motion detection using an IR sensor.
Automated servo control to dispense soap.
Compact and easy-to-implement design.

Applications:

Public places (malls, offices, hospitals) for hygiene control.
Smart home automation.
Hands-free operation to minimize contamination.

How to Use:

Power up the Arduino board.
Place your hand near the IR sensor.
The servo motors will activate, dispensing soap automatically.
Remove your hand, and the servos will reset.

Future Enhancements:

Integration with IoT for remote monitoring.
Adjustable soap dispensing quantity.
Battery-powered or solar-powered operation.
